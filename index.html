      <h3>Job Experience</h3>
      <p>After high school I went straight away into the military. I chose the Navy and tested into becoming a RM(Radiomen). The rate(job) was quickly changed after I started school. The new rate was now called IT. I served eight years and honorably discharged. After separating I worked as a contractor for government agencies doing system administration work for about 10 years. I really did not enjoy it but the money was good. I've worked with databases, sys admin, hardware, secure messaging systems and software installations.</p>

      <p>Then one day I decided to move to the west coast, Seattle specifically for a change of life. Shortly after my arrival I came across an ad for culinary school and signed up. In the very first week I knew I was home and right where I should be. In my second semester I got a job as a chef working for a restaurant that opened up in the 70s. That job lasted about 6 months and I landed at the Space Needle where I spent 2.5 years cooking in a high octane kitchen with sweltering heat and I loved every bit of it! I might still be there if the owners hadn't closed it for renovations</p>

      <p>The next job was at a non-profit with a mission to feed the homeless and hungry. I spent about the same amount of time there as well. </p>

      <p>I've always been curious about coding and learned about a veterans program that could help me get into the industry. I applied and then signed up with Code Fellows using my benefits</p>
